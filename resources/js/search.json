[[{"l":"Welcome to ETS2LA","p":["ETS2LA is a project that aims to finally bring self-driving technology to SCS Software's Truck Simulators. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses. If you have any questions, please ask in the Discord.","Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. \uD83D\uDE42","Unnamed User- ETS2LA Discord"]},{"l":"Features"},{"l":"Full access to simulator data","p":["Like many other applications we use a telemetry server in the ETS2 directory to get live data from the game. However unlike others we also have access to the games' road and prefab network to build a true full self-driving experience without the need for compute expensive vision models. You can now get those perfect cinematic shots without the need to hop onto multiplayer!"]},{"l":"Multilingual","p":["We provide an easy to use translation framework to translate ETS2LA into any language. Anyone can do this and the translations status is entirely driven by community efforts!"]},{"l":"Seamless navigation","p":["We have direct access to the in-game navigation route. ETS2LA will drive you to your destination, wherever it may be. This works with any map mod as long as the road data for said mod or mod combination has been extracted."]},{"l":"No expensive AI models","p":["ETS2LA is entirely handwritten and relies on absolutely no AI. This means that ETS2LA is much more lightweight and performance efficient than many comparable programs. We've also heavily implemented multiprocessing ensuring that each plugin has it's own CPU core to run on."]},{"l":"A rich developer experience","p":["ETS2LA includes an easy to use backend that will let anyone create beautiful and functional plugins for ETS2LA. You can define an entire settings page with just a few python code. We've also made a powerful event system that will let you listen to any events or keybinds from the game or within the app."]},{"l":"A beautiful and modern user interface","p":["Built on top of NextJS and shadcn, we've made an easy to use and beautiful interface that is highly inspired by real world self driving solutions.","Screenshots and Videos"]}],[{"l":"FAQ","p":["This page contains answers to some frequently asked questions and answers on how to fix them."]},{"l":"My wipers are stuck?","p":["This is a known issue with applications using the ETS2 / ATS input SDK. There's nothing we can do as this is a bug on SCS's end. There is a workaround in the main menu though. If you scroll all the way down, there will be a button to Fix wipers. Click that and alt tab to the game and the wipers will be automatically set to the lowest option."]},{"l":"The visualization is lagging a lot?","p":["That's just your PC. You can try to lower the graphics settings in the game as well as capping the in game FPS to give ETS2LA more resources to work with."]},{"l":"The game crashes when started with ETS2LA?","p":["Make sure that you have at least 16gb of RAM. ETS2LA is very memory hungry so you can also try closing other applications to free up more memory."]},{"l":"Visualization shows speed stuck at 54 km/h?","p":["Enable the Visualization Sockets plugin."]},{"l":"Visualization shows speed stuck at 4 km/h?","p":["Install the SDKs in the settings and restart the game."]},{"l":"The visualization pages are just white?","p":["Either use the Goodnightan mirrors or turn on a VPN so you can access GitHub. There is nothing we can do as we don't have the resources to host the visualization pages outside of GitHub."]},{"l":"Frontend loads indefinitely?","p":["Download NodeJS from here(nodejs.org) and install it. Next run the following code inside activate.bat"]},{"l":"ModuleNotFoundError No module named {...}","p":["Open the activate.bat file and run the following:","Still having issues? Try this instead:"]},{"l":"Failed to update / check for updates for the submodule {...}","p":["This is normal in places with a limited network environment. You can usually safely ignore this warning. If you do want to check for updates then you can remove the submodule in app/ and the app will redownload it. For example if the error is for the Translations submodule the you would delete the app/Translations folder and restart the app."]},{"l":"Git installation fails or Git is not installed. The app will not work?","p":["Download git-for-windows from wherever you can find it. For people in western countries this would be here(github.com). Install it and restart the launcher."]},{"l":"Invoke-WebRequest has an error?","p":["This has a few causes. The one sure fix is to run the start.bat file instead of start_tsinghua.bat. Just remember that if you are in China you will need a VPN in this case. There are also instructions on the Chinese part of the discord(ets2la.com) for how to help with this issue."]},{"l":"UnicodeDecodeError","p":["Make sure that the app is installed in a folder where the path only has western characters. You can for example install the app in C:\\ETS2LA or D:\\ETS2LA but not in C:\\Users\\你好\\Documents\\ETS2LA."]},{"l":"Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'","p":["Run the following code in the activate.bat file:"]}],[{"l":"With the Installer","p":["This guide will walk you through installing ETS2LA via the automatic installer."]},{"l":"Download the requirements"},{"l":"[!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"1\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"Optional\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"dark\" text=\"NodeJS\"]","p":["You can download NodeJS from here(nodejs.org).","NodeJS is only required if you want to run the frontend locally. If you are fine with accessing it through the internet, then you can skip this step."]},{"l":"[!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"2\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"Required\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"dark\" text=\"C++ Redistributable\"]","p":["Most people will already have ran vc_redist once, but in the case that you've never downloaded it before, you can get it from here(aka.ms)."]},{"l":"[!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"3\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"ghost\" text=\"Required\"] ‎ [!badge variant=\"dark\" text=\"Installer\"]","p":["You can now download the installer from here(github.com)."]},{"l":"Installing the app","p":["Just run the installer exe file you downloaded in the previous step. It will ask you for a few things, such as where to install the app and whether you want a desktop shortcut."]},{"l":"What to do once ETS2LA is open?","p":["Once the onboarding is done you can just go to the plugin manager and enable the plugins. Then open the game and it should just work."]}],[{"l":"Translation","p":["Thank you so much for your interest in translating ETS2LA! We are always looking for more translators to help us get ETS2LA accessible to even more people."]},{"l":"Our translation system","p":["We use a program called Weblate to manage our translations. This allows us to easily add new languages and update existing ones. Weblate is designed to be user-friendly and accessible for both the developers and the translators.","You can find our weblate instance on https://weblate.ets2la.com, you can start suggesting translations right away without needing to create an account. However if you want to directly contribute, you should contact @Tumppi066 on our Discord Server to get access to one. Translations will be added to ETS2LA automatically via updates, and you will be credited for each update you contribute to."]},{"l":"Terms of translation","p":["You agree that you are submitting all translations to the open source ETS2LA project for no payment.","You agree to translate the files solely according to information provided on the website.","You agree to not use external tools like artificial intelligence to translate for ETS2LA.","You agree to give ETS2LA sole ownership of the translations.","These terms are required to ensure that we maintain the quality of translations and that they can be added to our source code without any legal issues. If you do not agree to these terms, you can still suggest translations on our Weblate instance, but those will not be credited to you specifically."]}],[{"l":"Media","p":["This page will be expanded upon later."]}],[{"l":"Support Us","p":["Just your presence in the community is enough to keep us going! However if you do want to support us in other ways, then this page will tell you how to do that."]},{"l":"Translating ETS2LA","p":["We're always looking for more translators to help us translate ETS2LA to more languages. If you are interested in this, then please check the translation page below for more information.","Support Us"]},{"l":"Donate to fund development","p":["Money gained from donations is mostly going to fund the developers' ETS2 and ATS DLCs. We sometimes use the money to also train AI models for other more experimental plugins.","Below is a Ko-fi widget that you can use to donate to us, you can also just use the official ko-fi page.","The only official donation channel is the Ko-fi page linked here. If you see any other donation links then these are scams!","Support Us"]}],[{"l":"VTCs"},{"l":"I want to block the use of ETS2LA in/with my VTC/program","p":["That's totally fair! Just do a GET request to http://ets2la.local:37520 to detect any ETS2LA instance running on the local network, this includes instances that could be running on other computers. You can also specifically look for the ets2_la_plugin.dll in the game plugins directory, but this will not detect if ETS2LA is actually running.","Want to block your software on the ETS2LA side? Just contact me on Discord or via contact@ets2la.com and tell us your executable name, we will handle the blocking when we detect it's open."]},{"l":"I want to work with ETS2LA","p":["We provide developer documentation, if you need more info or want to talk to me then contact us on Discord or via contact@ets2la.com."]}],[{"l":"Privacy Policy","p":["Introduction","The information we store","How we use your information","Data Retention","Unregistered Users","Changes to this Privacy Policy"]},{"l":"Introduction","p":["This privacy policy applies to our cloud services, which you need to explicitly enable by logging in.
