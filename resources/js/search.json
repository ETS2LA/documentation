[[{"l":"Welcome to ETS2LA","p":["ETS2LA is a project that aims to finally bring self-driving technology to SCS Software's Truck Simulators. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses. If you have any questions, please ask in the Discord.","Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. \uD83D\uDE42","Unnamed User- ETS2LA Discord"]},{"l":"Features"},{"l":"Full access to simulator data","p":["Like many other applications we use a telemetry server in the ETS2 directory to get live data from the game. However unlike others we also have access to the games' road and prefab network to build a true full self-driving experience without the need for compute expensive vision models. This also means that ETS2LA will work regardless of the camera or game version.* You can now get those perfect cinematic shots without the need to hop onto multiplayer!"]},{"l":"Multilingual","p":["We provide an easy to use translation framework for anyone to translate the app into their own language. The app will reload said language file on the fly, so you can see your the changes instantly."]},{"l":"Custom made navigation system","p":["ETS2LA has a custom made A* based navigation system to find the shortest path to your destination**. This system is used because the game's own navigation system path cannot be accessed from the telemetry provided by the game."]},{"l":"State of the art custom AI models","p":["We use state of the art AI models that are trained on a large dataset of custom annotated images created and labeled by our community! This allows us to have a much more accurate and reliable experience than what you would get out of the box."]},{"l":"A rich developer experience","p":["We've built an easy to use backend that will let anyone create beautiful and functional plugins for ETS2LA. You can define an entire settings page with just a few lines of json. We also have a powerful event system that will let you listen to any events or keybinds from the game or within the app."]},{"l":"A beautiful and modern user interface","p":["Built on top of NextJS and shadcn, we've made an easy to use and beautiful interface that will let you easily find what you need. We also include a visualization of the current state around the truck built with godot. Said visualization is highly inspired by a certain EV company...","* The base self driving will work on any camera or game version, including VR use. But we still use vision models for vehicle detection, the app will not detect other vehicles and objects outside of the interior camera view.** The navigation system currently finds the shortest path. This is not guaranteed to be the fastest path.","Screenshots and Videos"]}],[{"l":"Support Us"},{"l":"Translating ETS2LA","p":["We are always looking for more translators to help us translate the app to more languages.

It allwos the neural network to know what an object is in an image. In order to create Vehicle Detection, we use an object detection model.It is a neural netowkr that can find cars, signs, and other objects on your screen for ETS2LA to process and use to createn a full self driving experience. Annotation comes in many forms, like, segmentation, bounding boxes, etc. For Vehicle Detection, we use a bounding box model called YOLO (You Only Look Once). This software allows us to easily create a state o the art object detection model. However, in order to train the model, we need to tell the model what to look for. This is where annotation comes in. We use a software called [insert software] which allows us to quickly and easily annotate these images with bounding boxes. Every bounding box has a \"class\". These can be in numeric form or in text form. You can check for a full list of classes at the end of this page. This is an example of what an annotated image looks like:","Annotation Example","You should notice that around every car in this image, there is a box. This is called a bounding box. Once you annotate that, the model now knows what in that image is a car, and what in that images is not a car."]},{"l":"Guidelines","p":["Now that you know what annotation is, there are some guidelines that you should read before starting.","Keep in mind that you are training a neural netowrk. Neural networks think like humans. If your human brain thinks that a vehicle should be detected, it most likely should. If you don't make it think like a human, it won't detect vehicles like a human can.","Only annotate objects that fall within the classes specified at the end of this page.","Make sure to annotate every vehicle and sign in the image with precision. The more precise the annotation is, the more accurate the model will be. This is very important for distance calculation.","If you don't know what an object is, don't annotate it. It will not help the model.","If an object is too blurry, don't annotate it. This is bad for the model. Of course, it can be slightly blurry because that's the nature of images. Here is an example of the most blurry vehicle that you should ever annotate:","Blurry Vehicle Threshold","If it is blurrier than the threshold, don't annotate it.","If you have any questions at all, please ask them in the Discord."]},{"i":"how-does-it-work","l":"How Does it Work?","p":["Coming soon."]},{"l":"Classes","p":["We have a total of 17 classes.
