[[{"l":"Welcome to ETS2LA","p":["ETS2LA is a project that aims to finally bring self-driving technology to SCS Software's Truck Simulators. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses. If you have any questions, please ask in the Discord.","Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. \uD83D\uDE42","Unnamed User- ETS2LA Discord"]},{"l":"Features"},{"l":"Full access to simulator data","p":["Like many other applications we use a telemetry server in the ETS2 directory to get live data from the game. However unlike others we also have access to the games' road and prefab network to build a true full self-driving experience without the need for compute expensive vision models. You can now get those perfect cinematic shots without the need to hop onto multiplayer!"]},{"l":"Multilingual","p":["We provide an easy to use translation framework to translate ETS2LA into any language. Anyone can do this and the translations status is entirely driven by community efforts!"]},{"l":"Seamless navigation","p":["We have direct access to the in-game navigation route. ETS2LA will drive you to your destination, wherever it may be. This works with any map mod as long as the road data for said mod or mod combination has been extracted."]},{"l":"No expensive AI models","p":["ETS2LA is entirely handwritten and relies on absolutely no AI. This means that ETS2LA is much more lightweight and performance efficient than many comparable programs. We've also heavily implemented multiprocessing ensuring that each plugin has it's own CPU core to run on."]},{"l":"A rich developer experience","p":["ETS2LA includes an easy to use backend that will let anyone create beautiful and functional plugins for ETS2LA. You can define an entire settings page with just a few python code. We've also made a powerful event system that will let you listen to any events or keybinds from the game or within the app."]},{"l":"A beautiful and modern user interface","p":["Built on top of NextJS and shadcn, we've made an easy to use and beautiful interface that is highly inspired by real world self driving solutions.","Screenshots and Videos"]}],[{"l":"Doesn't work!","p":["Please check these pages for other common issues, what you are looking for might not be on this page.

If you are using basic mode, then the enabled plugins will be listed to the left of the plugin manager page. If you are trying to connect via a remote device, then check the Remote Connection troubleshooting page."]},{"l":"ETS2LA is not steering.","p":["Make sure the Map plugin is enabled. If you find that the Map plugin is not enabled / not visible at all, then try to enable the Slow Loading option in Settings Global Variables. You should also increase your page file size to at least 8gb to 16gb.","Make sure you've selected the correct data for your mods / game. For example, if you're playing on ProMods, then you need to select the ProMods data in Settings Map Data.","Make sure you've selected a route in the in game map. ETS2LA does not work without a navigation route. You can select a route by clicking on the map in the game.","Make sure the visualization page shows a gray line. This gray line indicates that Map has currently found a route to follow. If you don't see the gray line, please follow the instructions in the warnings in the console. Usually this includes driving forward for 10-20 seconds, after which the gray line should appear.","Make sure you actually enabled the steering. By default the keybind for enabling the steering is the N key on your keyboard. You can change this in the settings. When Map is supposed to be steering the line will turn blue, and ETS2LA will take over steering control completely.","Is the line blue but it's still not steering? Did you not figure out your issue here? Please contact us on Discord(ets2la.com)."]},{"l":"ETS2LA is not controlling the speed.","p":["Make sure the Adaptive Cruise Control plugin is enabled. If you find that the Map plugin is not enabled / not visible at all, then try to enable the Slow Loading option in Settings Global Variables. You should also increase your page file size to at least 8gb to 16gb.","Make sure you actually enabled the speed control. By default the keybind for enabling the speed control is the N key on your keyboard. You can change this in the settings. When Adaptive Cruise Control is supposed to be controlling the speed, the speed in the top right will turn blue, and ETS2LA will take over speed control completely.","Try to enable / disable the fallback control mode. ETS2LA has two modes for controlling the speed. The fallback mode can be used when the primary mode fails. This can be enabled in Settings Global Variables.","Is the speed blue but it's still not controlling the speed? Did you not figure out your issue here? Please contact us on Discord(ets2la.com)."]}],[{"l":"Installer Fails"},{"l":"The installer doesn't open?","p":["We use a standardized installer called NSIS.

Also make sure you downloaded the installer from the official repository(github.com)."]},{"l":"I get an error message when installing?","p":["If the installer throws an error message, it can be one of many cases. To determine the problem you are facing correctly, please click Ok on the error message, and click the Show Details button in the installer window. You can then look at the latest logs to match them to cases you see below.","WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=4...","This means that the installer is having trouble connecting to python servers.

Opening the page should display the ETS2LA version.","Make sure your device can access http://ets2la.local:37520. If it can't, then the problem is between your device and the computer. We cannot help in this case, as networking is a rabbit hole of different devices and configurations.","Try to manually type the IP address of your computer, instead of pressing the Remote Connection button. This IP address is provided in the Visualization Sockets plugin settings, you can also find it by running ipconfig in a terminal."]},{"l":"WebUI","p":["You can also control the ETS2LA instance on your computer from an external device.

Please note that game crashes due to ETS2LA are extremely rare, most likely if you encounter a game crash it is because of limited resources on your computer.","To accurately determine the cause of the crash, please check the console for errors. This page will list those errors, and provide fixes for them."]},{"l":"ModuleNotFoundError No module named {...}","p":["This error means that ETS2LA is missing a Python submodule that's required to boot.

To fix the error, just run the following code after opening the activate.bat file in the ETS2LA installation directory."]},{"l":"The game crashes, I think it's ETS2LA doing it!","p":["Even though ETS2LA crashing your game is extremely unlikely, we can still run through some troubleshooting steps to see if we can figure out the problem.","Go to Settings - SDK and reinstall the SDK for your game. Does it work now? Great! Remember to always update the SDK when ETS2LA tells you, and when you update your game.","Go to Settings - SDK and uninstall the SDK for your game. Does it work now? If yes, then the problem is with the SDK. Please make sure you are using a supported version of the game. Usually that's the latest version, and the latest version that supports TruckersMP.","Do step 2, and close ETS2LA completely. Does it work? If yes, then you should increase your page file size. A value of 48gb - your memory works fine for most people.
