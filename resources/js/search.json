[[{"l":"Welcome to ETS2LA","p":["ETS2LA is a project that aims to finally bring self-driving technology to SCS Software's Truck Simulators. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses. If you have any questions, please ask in the Discord.","Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. \uD83D\uDE42","Unnamed User- ETS2LA Discord"]},{"l":"Features"},{"l":"Full access to simulator data","p":["Like many other applications we use a telemetry server in the ETS2 directory to get live data from the game.

You can now get those perfect cinematic shots without the need to hop onto multiplayer!"]},{"l":"Multilingual","p":["We provide an easy to use translation framework to translate ETS2LA into any language.

This works with any map mod as long as the road data for said mod or mod combination has been extracted."]},{"l":"No expensive AI models","p":["ETS2LA is entirely handwritten and relies on absolutely no AI. This means that ETS2LA is much more lightweight and performance efficient than many comparable programs.
