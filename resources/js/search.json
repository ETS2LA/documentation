This can be found in the console log, for example:[17:46:01] [INF] webserver.py Webserver started on http://192.168.1.135:37520 ( localhost:37520)-> 192.168.1.135 is the IP address.","Navigate your phone browser to http://your-ip:3000(ex. http://192.168.1.135:3000).","Type the IP once more into the input field and press connect."]}]]
