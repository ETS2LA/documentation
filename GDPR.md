# ETS2LA GDPR Policy

This is the GDPR policy that we must provide to you by law. TLDR: We promise we won't do anything bad with your data, we will only use it for good and legitimate purposes, and that you can always request to see what data we have on you and request for it to be deleted by emailing us at contact@ets2la.com. We also provide these options to you using our website.

We are a Data Controller of your information.

ETS2LA's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect the information:
- ETS2LA needs to perform a contract with you
- You have given ETS2LA permission to do so
- Processing your personal information is in ETS2LA's legitimate interests
- ETS2LA needs to comply with the law

ETS2LA will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
- The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you.
- The right of rectification.
- The right to object.
- The right of restriction.
- The right to data portability
- The right to withdraw consent

# Log Files
ETS2LA does not directly collect any log files. However, we have access to visitor's internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and date and time stamp through our DNS provider. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of this information is for analyzing trends, and for the protection and security of our website.

# Children's Information
Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

ETS2LA does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

# Consent
By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.
