3. How we use your information
4. Data Retention
5. Unregistered Users
6. Changes to this Privacy Policy

# Introduction
This privacy policy applies to our cloud services, which you need to explicitly enable by logging in. If you don't enable the cloud, ETS2LA will not collect any identifiable data whatsoever. Our websites (like the one you are currently on) might collect data about you via their hosts and DNS providers. You can find out more about this in our GDPR policy linked below.

We take your privacy seriously. As such, we collect as little identifiable information as possible and only use it for the purposes absolutely necessary to provide our services to you.

This is a very simple summary for normal people. We also have a proper [GDPR policy](https://ets2la.github.io/documentation/gdpr/). You might want to read that as well.

# The information we store
We only store the following **identifiable** information:
- You encrypted Discord user id. This is necessary to link your Discord account to a user account in our database.
- Your Discord username, this is used to display your username in the app.

We also store the following **non-identifiable** and **optional** information:
- Your ETS2LA settings.
- Your latest ETS2LA logs.
- A list of all the jobs you've completed while having ETS2LA open.
  - This information includes start, end, distance, time, income, truck statistics, and more. Check this [page](https://ets2la.github.io/documentation/developers/modules/#trucksimapi) for a full list of all the information available to us.
- Usage statistics
  - This includes used plugins and the amount of time you've spent in the app. It also includes the amount of time you've spent with different app features enabled / disabled.

# How we use your information
We will only use your data for providing services to you. We will never share any of your data with third parties, unless required by law.

# Data Retention
We will store your data for as long as you have an account with us. We provide no guarantees for data retention. Assume that it might be deleted at any time.

We provide an option to download all of your data. In the case of account deletion, we will delete all of your data from our server.

# Unregistered Users
We do not collect any identifiable information from unregistered users. However we do collect some non-identifiable information mentioned above. **For unregistered users, collecting said information is not optional.** However this information is not linked to any identifiable information, and is appended to a global database of all our users. This information is used for statistical purposes only, you can see these statistics on our website.

# Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will update this Privacy Policy if necessary, for example if we start storing more data as part of a new Service. If we do so, you will be notified via the announcements channel on our Discord Server. The last update date will also always be present at the very top of this Privacy Policy.

!!! Note
This privacy policy has been made using the [Vencord Privacy Policy](https://vencord.dev/cloud/privacy/) as a template. However the information provided here is specific only to **ETS2LA**.
