This overlay contains all the code required to convert 3D coordinates into the game world. The API for this plugin is made to be as easy to use as possible for 3rd party developers.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"Existing Plugins/Map/Extracting Map Data":{"id":"Existing Plugins/Map/Extracting Map Data","title":"Extracting Map Data","description":"This page will walk you through extracting additional Map data for ETS2LA. Please keep in mind that this is an advanced procedure that should only be attempted if you\'re confortable with a terminal and have at least some linux knowledge!","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"Getting Started/Creating Your First Plugin":{"id":"Getting Started/Creating Your First Plugin","title":"Creating Your First Plugin","description":"This is actually really easy! The entire framework has been made to make the initial setup as painless as possible. We should get you up and running in around 15 - 30 minutes!","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"Getting Started/Setting up a Development Environment":{"id":"Getting Started/Setting up a Development Environment","title":"Setting up a Development Environment","description":"While it is technically possible to develop for ETS2LA using the release environment via the installer, it is recommended to directly clone the program from GitHub.

It functions much like NextJS and it\'s SSR (Server Side Rendering). This means that you create components, that get rendered by the backend, and then sent over to the frontend to be displayed. This has some limitations, but it provides a very fast and flexible way for developers to create UI, you can use any CSS you wish!","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"Welcome":{"id":"Welcome","title":"Welcome!","description":"These pages have been written to document the ETS2LA framework and plugins so that other developers have the option of working with us.
