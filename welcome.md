# Welcome to ETS2LA
**ETS2LA** is a project that aims to finally bring self-driving technology to **SCS Software's Truck Simulators**. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses. If you have any questions, please ask in the Discord.

> Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. ðŸ™‚

### Features
#### :icon-git-branch: Full access to simulator data
Like many other applications we use a telemetry server in the ETS2 directory to get live data from the game. **However unlike others** we also have access to the games' road and prefab network to build a true full self-driving experience without the need for compute expensive vision models. You can now get those perfect cinematic shots without the need to hop onto multiplayer!

#### :icon-globe: Multilingual
We provide an easy to use translation framework to translate ETS2LA into any language. Anyone can do this and the translations status is entirely driven by community efforts!

#### :icon-location: Seamless navigation
We have direct access to the in-game navigation route. ETS2LA will drive you to your destination, wherever it may be. This works with any map mod as long as the road data for said mod or mod combination has been extracted.

#### :icon-log: No expensive AI models
ETS2LA is entirely handwritten and relies on absolutely no AI. This means that ETS2LA is much more lightweight and performance efficient than many comparable programs. We've also heavily implemented multiprocessing ensuring that each plugin has it's own CPU core to run on.

#### :icon-terminal: A rich developer experience
ETS2LA includes an easy to use backend that will let anyone create beautiful and functional plugins for ETS2LA. You can define an entire settings page with just a few python code. We've also made a powerful event system that will let you listen to any events or keybinds from the game or within the app. 

#### :icon-project: A beautiful and modern user interface
Built on top of NextJS and shadcn, we've made an easy to use and beautiful interface that is highly inspired by real world self driving solutions.
