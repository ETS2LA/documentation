!!! Thank you!
Just your presence in the community is enough to keep us going! However if you do want to support us in other ways, then this page will tell you how to do that.
!!!
#### Translating ETS2LA
We're always looking for more translators to help us translate ETS2LA to more languages. If you are interested in this, then please check the translation page below for more information. 

[!ref](/Guides/translation.md)

#### Donate to fund development
Money gained from donations is mostly going to fund the developers' ETS2 and ATS DLCs. We sometimes use the money to also train AI models for other more experimental plugins.

Below is a Ko-fi widget that you can use to donate to us, you can also just use the official [ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/tumppi066).

!!! Warning
The only **official** donation channel is the Ko-fi page linked here. If you see any other donation links then these are *scams*!
