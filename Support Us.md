### Translating ETS2LA
We are always looking for more translators to help us translate the app to more languages. If you are interested in helping us, then please check the translation page for more information.

### Become a helper on Discord
If you think you are well equipped to helping others with their issues, then you can simply head over to the #roles channel on discord to get the helper role. Keep in mind that people may ping you for help at any time, so only get the role if you truly willing.

### Become a Discord booster
This will help us keep many important discord features like the custom URL and better call quality. Just like with Ko-Fi donations you will receive an exclusive discord role for your donation.

### Donate to fund development
We use a lot of GPU time to train our AI models. Even a little will go a long way towards funding the continued development. You will also receive an exclusive discord role for your donation.

Below is a Ko-fi widget that you can use to donate to us.
