This guide will walk you through installing ETS2LA via the **automatic installer**.

#### Download the requirements
==- [!badge variant="ghost" text="1"] ‎ [!badge variant="ghost" text="Optional"] ‎ [!badge variant="dark" text="NodeJS"]
You can download NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/) *(nodejs.org)*.
!!! Tip
NodeJS is only required if you want to run the frontend locally. If you are fine with accessing it through the internet, then you can skip this step.

==- [!badge variant="ghost" text="2"] ‎ [!badge variant="ghost" text="Required"] ‎ [!badge variant="dark" text="C++ Redistributable"]
Most people will already have ran `vc_redist` once, but in the case that you've never downloaded it before, you can get it from [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) *(aka.ms)*.
=== [!badge variant="ghost" text="3"] ‎ [!badge variant="ghost" text="Required"] ‎ [!badge variant="dark" text="Installer"]
You can now download the installer from [here](https://github.com/ETS2LA/installer/releases/latest) *(github.com)*.
===

#### Installing ETS2LA
Just run the installer exe file you downloaded in the previous step. It will ask you for a few things, such as where to install the app and whether you want a desktop shortcut.

#### What to do once ETS2LA is open?
Once the onboarding is done you can just go to the plugin manager and enable the plugins. Then open the game and it should *just* work.
