Thank you so much for your interest in translating ETS2LA! We are always looking for more translators to help us get ETS2LA accessible to even more people.

#### Our translation system
We use a program called [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) to manage our translations. This allows us to easily add new languages and update existing ones. Weblate is designed to be user-friendly and accessible for both the developers and the translators.

You can find our weblate instance on https://weblate.ets2la.com, you can start suggesting translations right away without needing to create an account. However if you want to directly contribute, you should contact @Tumppi066 on our [Discord Server](https://ets2la.com/discord) to get access to one. Translations will be added to ETS2LA automatically via updates, and you will be credited for each update you contribute to.

#### Terms of translation
- You agree that you are submitting all translations to the open source ETS2LA project for no payment.
- You agree to translate the files solely according to information provided on the website.
- You agree to not use external tools like artificial intelligence to translate for ETS2LA.
- You agree to give ETS2LA sole ownership of the translations.

These terms are required to ensure that we maintain the quality of translations and that they can be added to our source code without any legal issues. If you do not agree to these terms, you can still suggest translations on our Weblate instance, but those will not be credited to you specifically.
