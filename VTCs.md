### I want to block the use of ETS2LA in/with my VTC/program
That's totally fair! Just do a GET request to http://ets2la.local:37520 to detect any ETS2LA instance running on the **local network**, this includes instances that could be running on other computers. You can also specifically look for the `ets2_la_plugin.dll` in the game plugins directory, but this will not detect if ETS2LA is actually running.

Want to block your software on the ETS2LA side? Just contact me on [Discord](https://ets2la.com/discord) or via contact@ets2la.com and tell us your executable name, we will handle the blocking when we detect it's open.

### I want to work with ETS2LA
We provide [developer documentation](https://ets2la.com/developers), if you need more info or want to talk to me then contact us on [Discord](https://ets2la.com/discord) or via contact@ets2la.com.
