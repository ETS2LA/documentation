### I want to block the use of ETS2LA in/with my VTC/program
That's totally fair! Just do a GET request to http://ets2la.local:37520 to detect any ETS2LA instance running on the local network.
If you want some more advanced blocking then you can contact me on discord @Tumppi066 or via contact@ets2la.com

### I want to work with ETS2LA
We provide [developer documentation](https://ets2la.com/developers), if you need more info or want to talk to me then contact us on Discord or via contact@ets2la.com.
